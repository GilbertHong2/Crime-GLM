# Crime-GLM

This project is to explore the relationship between crime incidents and different possible factors using the USA crime data in 1960, which was originally collected
by Ehrlich from the Uniform Crime Report of the FBI and other US government sources. This project emphasizes on building possible Generalized Linear Models (GLM) to model the crime incidents.

The final report is in the report pdf file. The used data files are included in the txt files in the directory.
